Implementation of MergeLife cellular automaton. https://www.heatonresearch.com/mergelife/

For rules to be compatible with original implementation rounding needs to be done exactly the same. I initially implemented all the calculation using integer operations, but for some rules result wasn't the same. So I switched to mix of integer and floating point operations the same as original implementation.
